# dmhandouts ![TravisCI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/branespace/dmhandouts.svg?branch=master)

A simple project to solve a problem that absolutely no one ever has.

In tabletop adventure/role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons, the Dungeon Master often has handouts he or she would like to give to the players.  This could include maps, pictures, diagrams, etc.

With the ubiquity of portable electronics, a simple web app could be used to present these documents without resorting to mass defoliation.
